## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Component Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.jsx                 # Main application component & state management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.jsx               # React app entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.css                # Global styles and component styling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.css              # Base HTML/body styles
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LyricsEditor.jsx   # Song creation/editing form
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SongList.jsx       # Song collection display with search
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LyricsModal.jsx    # Full-screen lyrics viewer with navigation
```

### State Management

The application uses React's built-in state management with hooks:

- **App.jsx**: Central state container for all songs and UI state
- **useState**: Local component state for forms and UI interactions
- **useEffect**: Side effects for localStorage sync and modal controls
- **Prop drilling**: Parent-to-child component communication

### Data Flow

1. **Songs Array**: Main data structure stored in App.jsx state
2. **localStorage Sync**: Bidirectional sync on app load and data changes
3. **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete via state setters
4. **Component Props**: Data and callbacks passed down to child components
